# Assignment
To do List assignment



This program uses the input() method to prompt the user for data and decisions.
I will attach two different programs. Tasklistmanagerapp I've spent the past week writing. Its contents go far beyond the scope of what the assignment calls for, using classes to handle the tasks of the task list, instead of a list. the second program toDoApp will have the functionality the assignment calls for.

TaskListManagerApp:
      Create new lists and load saved lists from a user specified directory
      Assign values to each task: status, urgency, description
      Delete task as a separate option from marking the task status as completed
      Uses a menu that allows the user to load and work on a different list or start a new list, or quit the application.
      Has decent error handling capabilities, mostly for handling file writing and reading errors.
      

ToDoListApp:
      Add tasks
      View tasks
      Delete tasks
      Quit the application
      Some Error handling regarding invalid choices for deleting items from a list
